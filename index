<h1> The World of James Sparks </h1>

  <h2> My Life in Short </h2>

<p> My name is James Sparks, I was born in New Jersey way back in 1990 and my 30's are only a couple a months a way. I grew up in a military family, and as a young child I had the privilege to live in Italy where I became fluent in Italian at the age of five. Sadly, no one else in my family could speak it so once we got back to the states I quickly lost it. After that, we moved to Alabama where my dad retired in near by Fort Benning, GA. That is where I ultimately lived a majority of my life until I joined the Air Force.
 Alabama is also where I met my wife Casey, while still in high school. We started dating my senior year and we ended up going to the same college, where we both earned our Associate Degree's. We got married in 2012, and in 2015 i decided to join the Air Force in order to go back to school. In 2018 our son Asa was born in South Dakota where I spent the first 3 years of my enlistment, and then our daughter was born in the beginning of 2020 where I currently live in England. </p>

<p> This page is dedicated to my love of travel. Living in the United Kingdom has offered me the opportunity to travel to parts of the world I would have never been able to see while living in the states.
